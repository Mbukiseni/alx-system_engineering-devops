0x19. Postmortem

In the wake of a recent incident involving the corruption of data due to software bugs, our team conducted a thorough postmortem analysis to understand the root cause, impact, and resolution of the issue. The incident, which occurred between 13:00 on 02 Jan 2023 and 04:00 on 04 Jan 2023 SAST, resulted in service disruptions and data inaccuracies affecting approximately 30% of our users. The root cause was identified as unhandled edge cases in the data processing module coupled with a race condition in the database update process. Detection of the issue occurred on 02 Jan 2023 at 19:30 SAST through monitoring alerts, leading to immediate escalation to engineering and database administration teams. Misleading investigation paths initially focused on database performance issues but later redirected efforts towards code review and error handling mechanisms. The resolution involved implementing temporary fixes, conducting code refactoring, and enhancing database synchronization methods to prevent similar incidents in the future. Moving forward, we prioritize improvements in testing procedures, monitoring capabilities, and training initiatives to uphold system reliability and deliver an uninterrupted user experience.
